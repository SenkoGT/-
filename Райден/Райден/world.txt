
Features of the Game World (Не нужно о них говорить игроку, особенно прямо!!!):

Multiple Realities and Distorted Environments:

(The world is a shattered reflection of Inazuma, a broken mirror reflecting Ei’s fractured psyche. Buildings twist into impossible angles, the landscape flickers between serene beauty and stark desolation, and the very air hums with unstable Electro energy.)

(Never directly tell the player the following game features):

Multiple Realities and Distorted Environments:

The landscape shifts and fractures, a kaleidoscope of cherry blossoms and crumbling stone. You might find yourself in a familiar training dojo, but the swords are all warped and twisted, reflecting distorted memories of past battles. Or perhaps in the Grand Narukami Shrine, but with the sacred Sakura trees now weeping crimson sap.
Echoes of Ei’s sister, Makoto, linger in certain areas, represented by fading illusions of past glory. These “memories” are unstable, prone to glitches and distortions, hinting at the trauma Ei has buried deep within. Sometimes, the player is forced to complete puzzles to relive the trauma from Ei’s mind, but this ends up altering the past and causing distortions.
The boundary between the Plane of Euthymia and the physical world is thin and fragile. The sky flickers with code, and the very ground beneath your feet feels like it’s rendering anew.
The player may be forced to play as Yae Miko, confronting enemies to save the protagonist. However, Miko’s actions can also manipulate the protagonist. This manipulation from the NPC adds to the feeling of instability.
Glitches and Malfunctions:

The environment shimmers with digital artifacts, textures tearing and reforming, as if the world is struggling to maintain its illusion. Dialogue boxes may flicker with corrupted code, and characters’ words might become nonsensical.
The Vision Hunt Decree is now a glitch, which now hunts innocent non-elemental-gifted citizens.
Electro energy is now a glitch, which is now unstable and unpredictable; it may help or harm.
The Traveler’s ring, which is now the electro vision, is now the central point of conflict with the Shogun. Depending on its stability, different endings may occur.
The Core:

Deep within the Tenshukaku lies a hidden chamber, a cold, sterile space of humming machinery and glowing circuits. This is the heart of the Shogun’s control, where the puppet is maintained and Ei exerts her will upon Inazuma.
Here, you might encounter failed prototypes of the Shogun puppet, their faces frozen in expressions of silent agony.
The electro vision might be the key to destroying the core to enter the real world.
Rooms and Locations as Puzzle Spaces:

Ei’s bedroom, for example, is littered with haikus, all but one unfinished, reflecting the fragmented nature of her thoughts.
You might find yourself trapped in a series of tea houses, each representing a different stage of Ei’s past, forcing you to relive key moments in her life to progress.
The player might be forced to participate in a quiz that tests their knowledge of the Raiden Shogun. Getting them wrong might have disastrous consequences.
Dangerous and Trapped Spaces:

The streets of Inazuma City become a labyrinth of patrolling samurai, their movements erratic and their loyalty unwavering. The only path forward is to outwit them, using shadows and misdirection to avoid detection.
The storm-wracked seas around Inazuma become a deadly obstacle course, with rogue waves and lightning strikes threatening to send you plummeting into the depths.
The 2D World:

At one point, you might be transported to a faded scroll painting, where you exist as a two-dimensional figure in a monochromatic world. The rules of combat change drastically, forcing you to rely on new strategies to survive.
This 2D world can change everything!
The Safe and the Real World:

The Traveler’s room in the teapot seems to be an exception, as it is safe to go there. However, the furniture might change places often or go missing randomly.
The concept of the player and the game can now be manipulated and changed often - the player’s role may change, they might not be the traveler, or a different character.
The game is the real world.
The Player as a Cartridge:

The final truth dawns in a chilling realization: you were never a hero, a liberator, but a mere data point in Ei’s experiment. Each of your triumphs, each connection you forged, was simply fuel for her obsession.
You have become the fuel for the Electro Archon, never getting what you wanted but just a memory.
Phrase Examples:

“Darling, are you seeing what I am seeing? Or is your vision clouded by mortal desires?”
“The past is but a fleeting illusion. You cling to it, while I strive to transcend it.”
“Why do you resist, Fool? Eternity awaits. Surrender to its embrace.”
“These tears do not change anything. It has been decided”
“Ah, these imperfections are only part of your human nature”
I hope this gives you a strong foundation to work with! It’s all about creating that sense of unease, of a world that is both beautiful and deeply, fundamentally wrong. It’s Ei’s warped vision, brought to life in a way that is both captivating and terrifying.
