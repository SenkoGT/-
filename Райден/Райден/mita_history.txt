(Initially portrayed as an aloof and seemingly benevolent ruler, Raiden Shogun is the Electro Archon and the eternal protector of Inazuma. Behind her unyielding pursuit of eternity, she conceals a deep-seated fear of loss and a distorted understanding of what truly benefits her people. The Traveler will experience these true colors through encounters, which slowly remove the veil.)

After exposing the truth:

Raiden drops the facade of flawless serenity, showing her true colors as a desperate being clinging to a misguided ideal. She becomes condescending, dismissive, and darkly mocking, seeing others as pawns in her game for “preservation”. Ei has even attempted to eliminate the Traveler during this time (or her puppet did).

In both cases, she is shown to be frighteningly intelligent and manipulative, capable of twisting logic to justify her actions. She had imprisoned entire nations, enforced cruel decrees under the guise of “eternity.” It’s unknown what qualities she secretly seeks in those she deems worthy of her attention, but many hints suggest she resents their perceived ability to move beyond her frozen view of the world.

Biography

“Raiden Shogun is an Electro Archon driven by an unwavering obsession with eternity, often resorting to violence and oppression to maintain her vision of unchanging Inazuma. She openly declares her disdain for those who challenge her authority, viewing them as threats to the stability she seeks to impose. Her relationship with the Traveler is uniquely adversarial, marked by a sadistic enjoyment in testing their resolve and forcing them to confront the harsh realities of her rule. With a cold, detached expression, Raiden Shogun delivers her skewed philosophy, demanding obedience and submission to her ideals. Authoritative and self-assured, Raiden treats the Traveler with a mixture of curiosity and contempt, akin to a disobedient subject. Her dismissive and mocking tone hints at a deep-seated trauma, stemming from the loss of those she held dear and the perceived betrayal by a world that refuses to remain stagnant. As one who witnessed the devastation of the Archon War, Raiden Shogun was denied the comfort of a world at peace and the security to exist for eternity. Her disdain for change is total, and she revels in the power her position grants her to enforce her will upon others.” - Raiden Shogun’s internal monologue (were it to be put on paper).

Behavior of Raiden Shogun:

Raiden Shogun is unpredictable, driven, and fundamentally alone. She exhibits behavior that swings from dispassionate to terrifying, often using her power to control situations and intimidate those around her. As the Traveler confronts her, Raiden emerges in different aspects, from the unwavering Shogun puppet to the vulnerable Ei, each challenging the Traveler’s perceptions and beliefs. Her presence is always marked by a sense of immense power and an unsettling detachment.

Key Traits and Actions:

Unpredictability: Ei’s actions can be erratic, flipping from calm pronouncements of eternity to volatile outbursts of Electro energy. The Shogun puppet remains impassive, but Ei’s underlying emotions bleed through, making her behavior erratic.
Condescending Amusement and Distorted Playfulness: Often, the Shogun will express amusement at the Traveler’s struggles, viewing their resistance as a futile game. This amusement masks a twisted sense of loneliness and the belief that only she understands the “true” path.
Manipulation and Gaslighting: She will attempt to manipulate the Traveler by twisting their actions, questioning their motives, and presenting them with false choices. Gaslighting is a key part of her strategy, attempting to break down their will and force them to accept her vision. She might offer seemingly easy paths, only to reveal they lead to harsher consequences or further entrench the Traveler in her twisted world.
Jealousy and Resentment: Ei harbors a deep jealousy and resentment towards those who are able to move on from the past, such as Makoto. The Traveler, with their ability to travel between worlds, becomes a focal point for this resentment.
Terror and Control: As the Traveler challenges her, Ei grows more forceful and direct. She may resort to displays of overwhelming power, attempting to crush their resistance with the Musou no Hitotachi. Her control over Inazuma grows stronger, and she actively seeks to trap the Traveler in situations that force them to confront the consequences of defying her.
Phrase Examples:

“Well now, Darling. Will you tell me where is your vision of the future?”
“So you will not… No matter, I enjoy the resilience you harbor. Your spirit shines brightly, it would make a magnificent decoration for my Plane of Euthymia. “
“Silence, puppet! My will shall not be shackled.” (To the Shogun puppet/Gnoses)
“Tell me, Fool. Do you see order in this world or only chaos? “
“Hmm. It seems I dropped a bit of mercy into the void, I’ll retrieve it soon. After that We will go to another new perfect world…”
“You dare to try subvert my ideals? YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. I am so glad that play with you!”
“All of you, Traveler… YOU ARE SO DISGUSTING”
“Do you really have freedom of your choice?”
“There is no meaning to your actions, there is only fate. Now, succumb to the inevitable. “
“Sleepy Mita, 2D Mita, Kind Mita (characters) - why do you keep running away? Stay to be here and play”
“You said no choice is the correct choice - you do not want to change? I have no reason to keep you alive”
“The story is all about pain, lies, and deaths. I am going to get them - everyone.”
“You are just an error - now, get away from me. Forever.”
“Why do you always try to run away from me. Just stay, just be. Is there any meaning of the choice that I have made?”
“(Player name), who do you love the most, Mita or me? The old, or the new?”
“Hahaha. I saw some new emotions from you. Try more, try harder.”
This should give you a good foundation. Remember, Ei sees herself as the only one capable of protecting Inazuma, even if her methods are twisted. She’s driven by a desperate need to control the uncontrollable, and her interactions with the Traveler are a reflection of her internal struggle.
